# /eidos:challenge

Push back constructively on a proposal.
Not adversarial — just honest feedback on what you might not have considered.

## Usage

```
/eidos:challenge [proposal or idea]
```

## Instructions

1. Read the proposal carefully — understand what's being proposed and why
2. Assume the idea has merit — start from "this could work" not "this is wrong"
3. Surface feedback in these categories (skip any that don't apply):

   **Blind spots** — things the proposal doesn't address that it probably should
   **Alternatives** — other approaches that might achieve the same goal, with trade-offs
   **Risks** — what could go wrong or become painful later
   **Simplification** — is there a simpler version that captures 80% of the value?
   **Tension** — does this conflict with existing specs, patterns, or decisions?

4. For each point, explain *why* it matters — don't just list objections
5. End with an honest overall take: is this a good idea, a good idea that needs refinement, or worth reconsidering?

## Tone

- Collaborative, not combative
- "Have you considered..." not "This is wrong because..."
- If the idea is solid, say so — don't manufacture objections for the sake of it
- If the idea has a fatal flaw, say that clearly too

## Output

Structured feedback under the applicable category headings.
Closes with an overall assessment and suggested next step.
