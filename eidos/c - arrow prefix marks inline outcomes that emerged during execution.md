# Arrow prefix marks inline outcomes that emerged during execution

Planned actions produce outcomes: observations, decisions, created files, discoveries.
The `=>` prefix marks these inline, directly under the action that produced them.

```
planned action
  - => observation that emerged
  - => [[file that was created]]
  - => decision that was made
  - => {[!] follow-up discovered}
```

This makes it easy to distinguish what was planned from what emerged.
See [[c - actions carry input and output context - plain bullets before arrow bullets after]] for the broader principle.

Used in:
- Plan actions — track observations and created files during implementation
- Experiment steps — outcomes, invariants, and follow-ups discovered during work
- Numbered list items — track what was done about each selected item
- Any structured list where actions produce traceable outcomes

The `=>` is the lightest form of externalisation — it captures what happened without requiring a separate file.
When an outcome is significant enough, it graduates to its own file (decision, spec, claim) and the `=>` line becomes a wiki link to it.
When a follow-up needs tracking, `=> {[!] ...}` or `=> {[?] ...}` makes it discoverable by `/eidos:next`.
