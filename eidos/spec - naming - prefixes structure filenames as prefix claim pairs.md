tldr: File naming conventions using prefix-claim pairs with compact timestamps for procedural files

# Naming — prefixes structure filenames as prefix claim pairs

## Target

Files need to be discoverable by both humans and tools. The filename itself should communicate what the file is (prefix) and what it says (claim). When browsing a directory or reading a wiki link, the name should be enough to decide whether to open it.

## Behaviour

### General Pattern

All files follow: `<prefix> - <claim>.md`

- The prefix identifies what kind of file it is
- The claim is prose — a readable phrase capturing the main content
- Claims can be used directly in sentences when wiki-linked: "as stated in [[c - the spec describes the full vision - versioning is for the procedural plan]]"

### Spec Files (intentional, in `eidos/`)

Spec files use `spec` as prefix, with an optional name segment:

```
spec - <claim>.md
spec - <name> - <claim>.md
```

The name segment groups related specs (e.g., skill names):

```
spec - drift - read only analysis of spec vs code divergence.md
spec - push - implements code to match spec.md
spec - naming - prefixes structure filenames as prefix claim pairs.md
```

Without name segment — for standalone specs:

```
spec refine loop uses double curly braces - creates refinement traces and adjusts spec.md
```

{[?] Should standalone specs still use the `spec -` prefix, or is the claim enough? Current practice is mixed.}

### Template Files (intentional, in `eidos/`)

Templates define the structure of procedural output files.
They use `template` as prefix with a name segment identifying what they template:

```
template - plan - structured phases with actions and progress tracking.md
template - decision - options and rationale for architectural choices.md
```

Templates are referenced by skills that produce procedural output.
See [[spec - template - basis for output files]] for the index and design rationale.

### Reference Files (intentional, in `eidos/`)

Reference docs capture external knowledge the project relies on but doesn't own.
They use `reference` as prefix:

```
reference - <claim>.md
```

Examples:

```
reference - DDD ubiquitous language grounds shared vocabulary.md
reference - Claude Code hooks execute shell commands on tool events.md
```

No timestamp — reference docs are stable, curated knowledge, not point-in-time snapshots.
See [[template - reference - curated external knowledge for project use]] for structure.

### Claim Files (intentional, in `eidos/`)

Claims that graduate to their own files use `c` as prefix:

```
c - the spec describes the full vision - versioning is for the procedural plan.md
c - eidos is self contained - definitions do not rely on external systems.md
c - each build mode is independent - entering one deactivates all others.md
```

The `c -` prefix identifies the file as a standalone claim.
Sometimes the name and the backlinks are the full signal.

### Procedural Files (in `memory/`)

Procedural files use a compact timestamp: `<prefix> - yymmddhhmm - <claim>.md`

```
refinement - 2602101418 - refine loop spec comment processing.md
drift - 2602101500 - building system divergence.md
solved - 2602122314 - document gid notation system.md
decision - 2602101400 - chose CSG over mesh booleans.md
```

Compact timestamp format: `yymmddhhmm` (10 digits, no separators)
- `26` = year, `02` = month, `10` = day, `14` = hour, `18` = minute
- Sorts chronologically in file browsers
- Shorter than `yyyy-mm-dd-hhmm` while remaining unambiguous

Procedural prefixes (timestamped): refinement, drift, coherence, decision, plan, goal, research, brainstorm, observation, review, todo, solved, architecture, bug, incoherence, learning, proposal, next, session, summary, pull, meta, goodjob

Non-timestamped prefixes (in `memory/`): idea, problem, question

`solved` is a renamed `todo` — when a todo is complete, rename from `todo -` to `solved -` (preserving timestamp and claim).

### Nesting

`eidos/` allows arbitrary nesting by user choice:

```
eidos/
  eidos.md
  skills/
    spec - drift - read only analysis of spec vs code divergence.md
    spec - push - implements code to match spec.md
  building/
    spec - building tools - csg based construction.md
    each build mode is independent - entering one deactivates all others.md
```

`memory/` is flat — no nesting.

## Design

### Why Prose Claims

When claims are written as prose, they can be:
- Used directly in sentences when wiki-linking
- Understood at a glance without opening the file
- Linked naturally: "as described in [[spec - drift skill - read only analysis of spec vs code divergence]]"

Avoid keyword-style names:
- Good: `spec - drift - read only analysis of spec vs code divergence.md`
- Avoid: `spec - drift - overview.md`

### Why Compact Timestamps

Procedural files are point-in-time snapshots. The timestamp in the name:
- Provides chronological sorting in file browsers
- Makes each file unique even with similar claims
- Is derivable from git, but convenient to have in the name for human browsing

The compact `yymmddhhmm` format saves characters while remaining readable with practice.

### Wiki Link Implications

Since filenames ARE wiki links, renaming a file breaks links. See the rename workflow in CLAUDE.md.

## Verification

- All files follow the prefix-claim pattern
- Spec files in eidos/ use `spec -` prefix or bare claim names
- Procedural files in memory/ use compact timestamps
- Wiki links match filenames exactly

## Interactions

- [[spec - eidos - spec driven development loops]] — naming applies to all files in both eidos/ and memory/
- [[c - eidos is self contained - definitions do not rely on external systems]] — naming conventions are defined here, not inherited from external systems
