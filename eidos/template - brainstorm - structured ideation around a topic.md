# Brainstorm: [Topic]

## Seed

What we're brainstorming about and why.
Enough context to stay focused without constraining ideas.

## Ideas

Raw ideas — quantity over quality, no filtering.

- ...

## Clusters

Related ideas grouped into themes.

### [Theme name]

- Ideas that connect
- What the thread is

## Standouts

Ideas worth pursuing — selected from clusters.
Brief rationale for each.

## Next Steps

What to do with the standouts.
Specs to create, decisions to make, prototypes to try.
```

## Field Reference

**Frontmatter:**
- `status` — `active` (still brainstorming), `complete`, `superseded`

**Seed:**
- Context and constraints, not a conclusion
- Link to related specs or problems that motivated the brainstorm

**Ideas:**
- Flat list, no hierarchy
- Capture everything — filtering happens later in Clusters and Standouts
- Wild ideas welcome — they can spark practical ones

**Clusters:**
- Emerge from the ideas, not imposed beforehand
- An idea can appear in multiple clusters
- Name themes descriptively — the name is the insight

**Standouts:**
- Not "best" ideas — ideas worth the next step
- Include brief rationale so the selection is reconstructable

**Next Steps:**
- Concrete actions, not vague intentions
- Link to specs, plans, or decisions as appropriate
